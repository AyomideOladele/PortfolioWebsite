                <h2 id= "About Me">Hello World!</h2>
				<p>
                    I'm currently a first-year at Queen Mary University of London, studying for a B.S.C in Computer Science. I began programming in 2015 and fell in love with solving problems with code. 
                    I enjoy both programming and understanding the hardware behind computers and how they are able to function. In my spare time when i'm not studying for my degree, you'll find me working out, baking, gaming and flicking through fashion magazines.
                    My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer and work on game development.
