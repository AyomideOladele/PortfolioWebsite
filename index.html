                    <p>
                        Hi! My name is Ayomide, (Ayo for short) and when I began coding back in secondary school, I immediately felt a strong affinity for it.
                        I've always loved using my creativity and imagination to transform the old into new. When I was younger, I would often experiment
                        with my hair and clothing - I would sneak into my mum's cupboard to steal her shirts, so I could fold them and pin them onto my body
                        to create new silhouettes, and I would spend ages in front of the mirror before school finding unconventional and elaborate new ways
                        to style my hair.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I found that programming offered an identically enjoyable experience - all the tools to create new things have been built by
                        the amazing coders before us, and now we can mix and mold their expertise into creating our own unique visions. I love the creative
                        freedom programming gives me, but even more than that, I love the challenge it offers. Creating new things is never easy as it requires
                        a lot of trial and error. Luckily, I don't mind this part of the process, because after the long nights, and 'back to square one's',
                        finally breaking through and getting something to work the way you originally imagine it to is an amazingly fulfilling feeling.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now, I'm a Computer Science graduate, and have achieved a first class from a top university. But the learning is far from over.
                        I aspire to understand all the unique aspects Computer Science inside and out, so I can shorten the trial and error process, and
                        get to the creating part faster than ever.
